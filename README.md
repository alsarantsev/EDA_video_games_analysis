# Video games sales analysis

<p>The project involves working for the online store Ice, which operates a global video game marketplace. The project aims to uncover potential blockbuster games and facilitate the planning of effective advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>The dataset available includes user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales. The dataset provided covers historical data going back to 2016. Assuming it is December 2016, the project focuses on planning a campaign for the following year, 2017. The project's primary emphasis is on gaining experience in working with data, regardless of whether the goal is to forecast 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or analyze 2017 sales based on 2016 data.</p>

<p>Additionally, the dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB, which stands for the Entertainment Software Rating Board. ESRB evaluates the content of video games and assigns age ratings such as Teen or Mature to indicate the appropriate target audience for each game. This information is valuable in understanding the relationship between a game's content and its success in the market.</p>

<p><h2>Questions</h2>
  
The objective is to analyze this data to identify patterns that determine the success or failure of video games.

The main areas of study in this project are:

1. Define the lifecycle of the platform. 
2. Analyze the sales variation across different platforms and genres, identifying platforms and genres with the greatest total sales and assessing their growth or decline.
3. Compare global games sales broken down by platform, determining whether significant differences in sales and average sales across platforms exist.
4. Investigate the correlation between user and professional reviews and sales for one popular platform, concluding their impact.
5. Build the profile for each region (North America, Europe, and Japan) and determine how the shares of platforms and genres vary. Do ESRB ratings affect sales in individual regions
</p>

<p><h2>Summary </h2>
  
1. The lifecycle of platforms lasts around 9-10 years, with new platforms appearing and old ones fading after approximately 6 years. The period with the highest sales usually lasts 3-5 years.
2. To build a prognosis for 2017, it is recommended to work with data from 2013 onwards, disregarding previous years' data.
3. Promising platforms for potential profitability are "PS4" and "XOne," despite declining sales in 2016.
4. Differences in sales among platforms are not significant based on the box plot analysis.
5. A positive but weak correlation between critics' scores and sales indicates some impact but not a strong relationship. User scores have little impact on sales.
6. Comparing sales of the same games on different platforms, the correlation between sales and critic scores remains positive but varies in strength. The correlation between sales and user scores fluctuates and lacks consistency.
7. For Europe and North American markets:
I strongly suggest focusing on increasing attention towards games in the genres of "Action", "Shooter," and "Sports" on two highly profitable platforms, "PS4" and "XOne". In the future, advertising campaigns should be tailored towards pushing these games onto the market.
For Japan region:
I suggest focusing on the genres "Action", "Shooter", and "Role-Playing" on platforms such as "3DS" and "PS4". Additionally, it may be beneficial to explore available promotional offers.</p>
